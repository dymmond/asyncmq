        Initializes a new Job instance.

        Args:
            task_id: The unique identifier string for the task function that this
                     job is intended to execute. This ID is used to look up the
                     actual callable function in the task registry.
            args: A list of positional arguments to be passed to the task function
                  when the job is executed.
            kwargs: A dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed to the task
                    function.
            retries: The number of times this job has already been attempted
                     (usually 0 for a new job, incremented on failure). Defaults to 0.
            max_retries: The maximum number of times this job is allowed to be
                         retried before being marked as failed. Defaults to 3.
            backoff: Defines the strategy for calculating the delay before the
                     next retry attempt after a failure.
                     - If a number (int or float), the delay is calculated as
                       `backoff ** retries`.
                     - If a callable that accepts the retry count (`callable(retries)`),
                       the delay is the result of calling it with the current
                       retry count.
                     - If a callable that accepts no arguments (`callable()`),
                       the delay is the result of calling it.
                     - If None, there is no delay between retries (retries happen immediately).
                     Defaults to 1.5. Note: Original type hint includes `Any` which
                     suggests other callable types might be supported.
            ttl: The time-to-live (TTL) for the job in seconds, measured from
                 its creation time (`created_at`). If the current time exceeds
                 `created_at + ttl`, the job is considered expired. Defaults to None
                 (no TTL).
            job_id: An optional pre-assigned unique ID for this job. If None, a new
                    UUID is generated. Defaults to None.
            created_at: An optional timestamp (as a float, e.g., from time.time())
                        representing when the job was created. If None, the current
                        time is used. Defaults to None.
            priority: The priority level of the job. Lower numbers typically indicate
                      higher priority for processing. Defaults to 5.
            repeat_every: If set to a number (float or int), this job is a repeatable
                          job definition, and new job instances will be enqueued
                          periodically with this interval (in seconds) by the
                          repeatable scheduler. Defaults to None.
            depends_on: An optional list of job IDs (strings) that this job depends on.
                        This job will not be executed until all jobs listed in
                        `depends_on` have completed successfully. Defaults to None.
