# Installation & Setup

Get AsyncMQ up and running in minutes—no arcane dark magic required.

## 1. Supported Install Methods

### a. PyPI (pip)

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install asyncmq
```

### b. Poetry

Add to your Poetry project:

```bash
poetry add asyncmq
```

!!! Tip
    Pin to a minor version for stability, e.g., `asyncmq~=0.3.2`.

---

## 2. Docker & Docker Compose

Spin up AsyncMQ with your favorite backend in a containerized environment.

### a. Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

  asyncmq-worker:
    image: python:3.11-slim
    environment:
      # Point to custom settings (optional, see below)
      - ASYNCMQ_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.settings.AsyncMQSettings
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    working_dir: /app
    command: ["asyncmq", "worker", "start", "default", "--concurrency", "4"]
    depends_on:
      - redis
```

Launch it all with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The command its straightforward and if you wonder *"but how does AsyncMQ knows about which backend to run?"* type of thing,
that is because **AsyncMQ** has the concept of [settings](features/settings.md) where **you can override** the backend to run
the one at your choice and using the `ASYNCMQ_SETTINGS_MODULE` to start your application.

You can read more about the `ASYNCMQ_SETINGS_MODULE` in the [settings](features/settings.md) section for more details.

---

## 3. Configuration Overrides (Custom Settings)

By default, AsyncMQ loads its configuration from `asyncmq.conf.global_settings.Settings`, which includes sensible defaults such as:

* **backend**: `RedisBackend(redis_url="redis://localhost")`
* **worker_concurrency**: `10`
* **logging_level**: `INFO`
* **debug**: `False`

To override these defaults, define a custom settings class in your project. For example:

```python
# project/settings.py
{!> ../docs_src/installation/custom_settings.py !}
```

Then set the `ASYNCMQ_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to point at your settings:

```bash
export ASYNCMQ_SETTINGS_MODULE="project.settings.AsyncMQSettings"
```

Now all AsyncMQ CLI commands and API consumers will pick up these overridden values.

## 4. CLI Helpers & Taskfile

AsyncMQ ships with a handy CLI. You can streamline common commands by using a [`Taskfile.yaml`](https://taskfile.dev/))
or whatever helps you streamline common commands, some still love going vintage (like this author) and still use the `Makefile`
but the advantage of a `Taskfile` its that is OS agnostic:

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  mq:            # Alias to invoke any asyncmq command
    cmds:
      - asyncmq {{.cmd}} {{.args}}

  worker:
    cmds:
      - asyncmq worker start default --concurrency=${CONCURRENCY:-10}
      env:
        CONCURRENCY: 4

  list-active-jobs:
    cmds:
      - asyncmq job list --queue default --state active
```

You can add as many commands as you see fit.

---

## 5. First Run & Smoke Test

After installation, verify everything is wired correctly:

```bash
asyncmq --help
```

You should see:

```text
Usage: asyncmq [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  AsyncMQ CLI

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  info    Provides information about the AsyncMQ installation and...
  job     Manages AsyncMQ jobs within queues.
  queue   Manages AsyncMQ queues.
  worker  Manages AsyncMQ worker processes.
```

You can also do `asyncmq` directly in the command line and you should see something like this:
