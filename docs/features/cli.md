# AsyncMQ CLI

The `asyncmq` CLI is your command-line control center for managing queues, jobs, workers, and configuration,
all wrapped in a splashy Rich banner and powered by Click.

---

## Installation & Entry Point

Install AsyncMQ into your Python environment:

```bash
pip install asyncmq
```

Invoke the CLI with:

```bash
asyncmq [group] [command] [options]
```

Show global help:

```bash
asyncmq --help
```

!!! Tip
    You can also run it as a module:

```bash
python -m asyncmq
```

### Custom Settings Module

By default, AsyncMQ loads configuration from `asyncmq.conf.global_settings`.

To override this, set the `ASYNCMQ_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable:

```bash
export ASYNCMQ_SETTINGS_MODULE=your.project.settings
```

This allows you to point the CLI at your own `Settings` dataclass (with custom backends, rate limits, sandbox options, etc.).

---

## Command Groups Overview

The CLI is organized into four primary groups:

* **`queue`**: Manage queues (list, pause/resume, inspect delayed & repeatables)
* **`job`**: Inspect, list, retry, remove, or cancel individual jobs
* **`worker`**: Start worker processes to consume queues
* **`info`**: Display current backend implementation

Each group supports its own set of subcommands and flags. Run `asyncmq <group> --help` to see usage.

---

## `asyncmq info`

Displays the configured backendâ€™s Python import path.

```bash
asyncmq info
```

**Output Example:**

No additional flags or subcommands.

---

## `asyncmq queue` Commands

Manage and inspect your queues:

### `list`

List all queues known to the backend.

```bash
asyncmq queue list
```

### `info <queue>`

Show stats for a specific queue:

* Paused state
* Counts of waiting, delayed, failed jobs

```bash
asyncmq queue info myqueue
```

### `pause <queue>`

Stop workers from pulling new jobs off a queue.

```bash
asyncmq queue pause myqueue
```

### `resume <queue>`

Restart processing of a paused queue.

```bash
asyncmq queue resume myqueue
```

### `list-delayed <queue>`

Show all jobs scheduled for future execution.

```bash
asyncmq queue list-delayed myqueue
```

### `remove-delayed <queue> <job_id>`

Cancel a delayed job by ID.

```bash
asyncmq queue remove-delayed myqueue 123e4567
```

### `list-repeatables <queue>`

List all repeatable job definitions on a queue.

```bash
asyncmq queue list-repeatables myqueue
```

### `pause-repeatable <queue> '<job_def_json>'`

Pause a specific repeatable definition (given as its JSON dict).

```bash
asyncmq queue pause-repeatable myqueue '{"task_id":"app.heartbeat","every":60}'
```

### `resume-repeatable <queue> '<job_def_json>'`

Un-pause and reschedule a paused repeatable.

```bash
asyncmq queue resume-repeatable myqueue '{"task_id":"app.heartbeat","every":60}'
```

!!! Warning
    **JSON Strings** must be wrapped in single quotes in most shells to prevent interpretation.

---

## `asyncmq job` Commands

Operations on individual jobs:

### `list --queue <q> --state <state>`

List jobs filtered by state (`waiting`, `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `delayed`).

```bash
asyncmq job list --queue myqueue --state failed
```

### `inspect <job_id> --queue <q>`

Dump full job data (args, status, timestamps) as JSON.

```bash
asyncmq job inspect 123e4567 --queue myqueue
```

### `retry <job_id> --queue <q>`

Re-enqueue a completed or failed job.

```bash
asyncmq job retry 123e4567 --queue myqueue
```

### `remove <job_id> --queue <q>`

Delete job metadata completely.

```bash
asyncmq job remove 123e4567 --queue myqueue
```

### `cancel <job_id> --queue <q>`

Signal in-flight job to stop and remove it from future processing.

```bash
asyncmq job cancel 123e4567 --queue myqueue
```

---

## `asyncmq worker` Commands

Control worker processes consuming queues:

### `start <queue> [--concurrency N]`

Launch a worker that processes up to `N` jobs concurrently (default 1).

```bash
asyncmq worker start myqueue --concurrency 5
```

* Press **Ctrl+C** to gracefully shut down.
* Banner shows version, backend, queue, and concurrency.

---

## Putting It All Together

* Start a worker for "emails" queue, 3 at a time - `asyncmq worker start emails --concurrency 3`
* List all queues - `asyncmq queue list`
* Pause processing on retries - `asyncmq queue pause retries`
* Inspect a failed job - `asyncmq job inspect abc123 --queue retries`
* Retry it - `asyncmq job retry abc123 --queue retries`
* Monitor delayed tasks remaining - `asyncmq queue list-delayed retries`
* Resume and let it rip again - `asyncmq queue resume retries`

!!! Tip
    Pipe output through your own `jq` or `grep` to integrate AsyncMQ into shell scripts and dashboards!

With this CLI at your fingertips, you can administer queues, recover from failures, and scale workers,
all without leaving your terminal. Enjoy the power (and the pretty panels)! ðŸŽ‰
